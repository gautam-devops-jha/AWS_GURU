# EBS Encryption
* When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
    - Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
    - All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted 
    - All snapshots are encrypted
    - All volumes created from the snapshot
* Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
* Encryption has minimal impact on latency
* EBS encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
* Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption
* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted 

## Encryption: encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume
* Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
* Encrypt the EBS snapshot (using copy) (select encryption checkbox)
* Create new ebs volume from the snapshot (the volume will also be encrypted)
* Now you can attach the encrypted volume to the original instance
