# A brief History

Before talking about the History of AWS let's brust some rumors first.

## Rumours
People thinks that AWS was created because Amazon had excess computing capacity from the servers that run amazon.com and that they wanted to make more use of those servers. But it's not true. 

With the co-author of the initial proposal of AWS, Benjamin Black, responding to it with *"Why will that not die? It's totally false."*

## The real Story

The real story is that Benjamin Black and his manager, Chris Pinkham were exploring ways to effeciently scale up their infrastructure. And what i mean by that is how could they easily make their website or application work when accessed by a lot of people at the same time? And traditionally to do this, you would simply install a lot of servers in your server room, enough that you would be able to successfully serve the amount of customers you have when you hit the peak of your traffic. 

So say you need 10 servers to serve 1,000 customers and your peak traffic during a sale period like Black Friday is 5,000 customers. Then you need 50 server room at all times. 

What the explored was methods of separating the applications from the infrastructure. If they could achieve this it would be easier to manage both the applications and the infrastructure running them. And they realized they might be a lot of value in doing that even to people outside Amazon. and they might be able to sell Infrastructure as a service. 

They wrote up the idea and itt made it's way all the way to jeff Bezos who greenlit the proposal. And they led the team to build elastic compute cloud or EC2,  which is a virtual machine as a service, one of AWS's first products released in 2006. 

# AWS Services Timeline 
Exact timelines are difficult to find, but 

**2006 March** :- Amazon S3 as the first service released by AWS  
**2006 July** :- Amazon Simple queue service SQS
**2006 Aug** :- Amazon EC2 service. 

SQS had actually been around and in use by Amazon internally since 2004, And they realized it could be released as a managed service, so they did so in 2006. 

From then afterward new services get released.
