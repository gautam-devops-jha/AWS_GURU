# AWS 
AWS stands for **Amanzon Web Services,**  

Depending on context it refers to two different things :-
1. It is a collection of different computer programs or services that Amazon have on offer for you to use to build your own websites or applications in the cloud. 
2. It also refers to the IT management company that create and support these services for you. 

We will be studing about the cloud AWS not the IT management.
