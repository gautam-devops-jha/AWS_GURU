# Some Key Points
- **IAM is Universal :** It does not apply to regions at this time.

- **The Root Account :** The Account created when you first setup your AWS account and which has complete admin access. Secure it as soon as possible and do not use it to log in day to day.

- **New User :** No Permissions when first created.

- **Access Key ID and Secret Access key :** They are created when a user is created and they are not same as username and password, it is used foor programmatical access to AWS. you can view these only once so if you lose them you have to regenerate them. So save them in secure location.

- **Always set up password rotation** You can create and customize your own password rotation policies.
